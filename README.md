# Supervised_machine_learning

Background
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.

You will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

Import the data using Pandas. Display the resulting dataframe to confirm the import was successful.

Create, Fit and Compare Models
Create a Logistic Regression model, fit it to the training data that you created in the previous step. Then, determine the model's score by using the score function and the testing data from the previous step. Do the same for a Random Forest Classifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like.

Review the scores of each model. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts in the designated markdown cell.

Conclusion: Whilst my prediction was that the Logistic Resgression model wodel perform better after scaling the data I concluded that the Random Forrest Classifier was a better fit as there was less variation between the scaled and non scaled data
